# Music-Streaming-App

It is a simple app for streaming songs, where a user can listen to music, read its lyrics, create their own playlist, rate songs, search through the vast range of songs available to them and browse through all the available albums & genres. One of the key features that the app offers is that it allows a user to register themselves as creator, giving them the power to upload songs and create new albums out of them. While there’s also a special type of user called “the admin”. A admin can browse through all the songs uploaded by the creators, view the app statistics and also mark a creator as blacklisted/whitelisted depending on the app policies.
